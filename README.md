# Customer Segmentation with K-Means (R Project)

This project is built using the **same Superstore dataset** I used in my previous EDA project.  
After exploring sales trends, profits, and categories in the earlier analysis, I took the next step â€” segmenting customers using **K-Means clustering** to uncover deeper behavioral patterns.

The goal is to identify groups such as:
- High-value customers
- Discount-driven buyers
- Casual shoppers
- Loyal regulars

By understanding these segments, businesses can create targeted strategies for marketing and retention.
File | Description |
| `superstore.k-clus.Rmd` | R Markdown file with full workflow |
| `superstore.k-clus.docx` | Knitted Word report with plots & insights |
| `Sample - Superstore.csv` | Dataset used (optional) |
| `README.md` |

Tools & Packages Used

- R & RStudio
- `tidyverse` for data wrangling
- `factoextra` for cluster visualization
- `kmeans()` from base R

Insights from Clustering

- **Cluster 1:** High spend, high profit, frequent orders â€” ideal loyalty targets
- **Cluster 2:** High discounts, low or negative profit â€” risky segment
- **Cluster 3:** Casual buyers â€” low engagement
- **Cluster 4:** Mid-tier regulars â€” stable but moderate

 Business Recommendations

- Promote exclusive offers to high-value customers
- Rework discount strategy for low-profit segments
- Run engagement campaigns for casual buyers
- Upsell to regular customers with moderate spend
