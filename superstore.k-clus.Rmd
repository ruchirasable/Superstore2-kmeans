# Introduction
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their behavior using the Superstore dataset.  
By grouping similar customers, businesses can target them more effectively, tailor marketing strategies, and increase profitability.

We’ll use R and the following tools:
- `tidyverse` for data wrangling
- `ggplot2` and `factoextra` for visualizations
- `kmeans()` for clustering

# Loading and Cleaning the Data
``` library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# Load data
df <- read_csv("Sample - Superstore.csv")

# Clean column names
df <- clean_names(df)

# Remove duplicates
df <- df[!duplicated(df), ]

# Convert date columns
df$order_date <- as.Date(df$order_date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
df$ship_date <- as.Date(df$ship_date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# Check structure
str(df)
```
#We grouped data by customer to create features like total sales, total profit, average discount, and total number of orders. This allows us to cluster customers based on their overall behavior.

#Scaling the data
```# Remove IDs before scaling
scaled_data <- scale(customer_data[, -c(1, 2)])

# Check scaled values
head(scaled_data)
```
We scale the data to ensure all variables are on the same scale, which is essential for K-Means to work properly.

```set.seed(123)
kmeans_result <- kmeans(scaled_data, centers = 4)

# Add cluster labels
customer_data$cluster <- as.factor(kmeans_result$cluster)
```
We use `kmeans()` to segment the customers into 4 clusters. The results are added back to the customer dataset.

#Visualing the data
```install.packages("factoextra")
library(factoextra)

fviz_cluster(kmeans_result, data = scaled_data,
             geom = "point",
             palette = "jco",
             ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```
This plot shows how customers are grouped in 2D space. Each color represents a different cluster.

#Cluster Profiles (Summary Table)
```
customer_data %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_sales = mean(total_sales),
    avg_profit = mean(total_profit),
    avg_discount = mean(avg_discount),
    avg_orders = mean(total_orders)
  )
```
This table helps us understand the behavior of each customer segment.

#Business Insights
## Cluster Insights

- **Cluster 1 – High-Value Customers**  
  High sales and profit, low discount usage, frequent orders. Ideal for loyalty campaigns.

- **Cluster 2 – Discount-Driven Loss-Makers**  
  High discount usage, low or negative profit. Review pricing or offer strategy.

- **Cluster 3 – Casual Buyers**  
  Low spend, low order count. Target with reactivation campaigns.

- **Cluster 4 – Reliable Regulars**  
  Medium spend and profit, frequent orders. Potential for upselling.

# Conclusion

Using K-Means Clustering in R, we segmented customers based on behavioral data from the Superstore dataset.  
This approach enables targeted marketing and strategic customer engagement.

Next steps could include:
- Creating dashboards in Tableau
- Applying more advanced clustering like DBSCAN
- Analyzing churn risk by segment
